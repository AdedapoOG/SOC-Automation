# SOC-Automation
# üõ°Ô∏è Security Operations Center (SOC) Home Lab

##  Project Overview
This project sets up a **Security Operations Center (SOC) Home Lab** to monitor, detect, and respond to cyber threats. The lab includes **Splunk SIEM**, **Snort IDS**, and **Metasploit** to simulate real-world attacks and analyze security events.

## **Objectives**
 **Deploy Splunk SIEM** to collect and analyze security logs.  
 **Implement an IDS (Snort)** to detect network intrusions.  
 **Simulate cyber attacks** using Metasploit on a vulnerable machine.  
 **Automate detection and response** using custom Splunk rules.  
 **Generate a report** on attack scenarios and mitigation techniques.

## Configuring VMware Networking
I configured a Host-Only Network (VMnet2) so that all three VMs can communicate securely without internet access.

To verify Network Connectivity I pinged kali ip and metasploit ip address to ensure the virtual machines can communicate

# Phase 2: Installing and Configuring Splunk SIEM 

##  Overview  
In this phase, I installed and configured Splunk SIEM on Ubuntu Server to collect and analyze security logs from Kali Linux and Metasploitable. This setup enables log monitoring, threat detection, and attack analysis within the SOC home lab.

##  Update Ubuntu and Install Dependencies
Before installing Splunk, I updated Ubuntu and installed essential tools.
sudo apt update && sudo apt upgrade -
This ensures that the system has the latest security updates and required utilities for downloading Splunk.

## Download and Install Splunk
I tried to download Splunk Enterprise from Splunk‚Äôs official website using the wget command

but I realised I had to connect ubuntu to the internet, I then changed the host to allow internet and I was able to download the application and ensure that the system has the latest security updates and required utilities.

##  Start and Configure Splunk
After installation, I navigated to the Splunk directory and started the service I alsi enabled it to boot on start

##  Accessing Splunk Web Interface
Once Splunk was running, I accessed the web interface from my host machine‚Äôs browser using the Ubuntu VM's IP.

#  Phase 3: Configuring Log Collection in Splunk

##  Overview  
In this phase, I configured Kali Linux (Attacker) and Metasploitable (Victim) to send system logs to Splunk SIEM (Ubuntu Server). This allows monitoring of security events such as login attempts, attack simulations, and suspicious activities.

##  Configure Kali Linux to Send Logs to Splunk
On Kali Linux, I modified the syslog configuration file to forward logs to Splunk SIEM.

## Verified Splunk for forwarding
I tried to verify if logs are being received by splunk from Kali and Metasploit

logging successful from both machines


to help detect unauthorized changes to logs I configured splunk to verify check

## In a nutshell
In **Phase 3**, I configured log forwarding from **Kali Linux** and **Metasploitable** to **Splunk** via **UDP port 514**, ensuring that security logs are centralized for analysis. I first enabled **Splunk to receive logs**, set up a **syslog input**, and verified connectivity. On **Kali**, I installed and configured **rsyslog**, resolving package issues, modifying `/etc/rsyslog.conf`, and confirming log forwarding using `tcpdump`. Similarly, on **Metasploitable**, I adjusted **rsyslog settings**, restarted the service, and verified log transmission. After ensuring both machines were successfully sending logs, I ran **Splunk queries** to confirm event ingestion, analyzed logs using **statistics and event searches**, and optimized **log retention settings** via `indexes.conf`. The phase was successfully completed with **Splunk receiving and displaying logs from both sources**, setting the foundation for **security event detection and analysis** in **Phase 4**.

## **4. Attacking Phase**
### **4.1 Conducting Attacks with KALI**
- Simulated various attacks, including:
  - Exploiting vulnerabilities on the target machine.
  - Running reverse shell payloads.
  - Brute-force attacks.
- Captured attack data in Splunk for monitoring.

### **4.2 Alerting and Automated Response**
- Configured Splunk alerts to trigger upon detecting suspicious activity.
- Set up a response mechanism to automatically block the attacking IP (Kali Linux).
- Verified alerts were successfully triggered in Splunk.

## **5. Findings & Observations**
### **5.1 Successful Outcomes**
- Splunk successfully ingested logs and detected the simulated attacks.
- Alerts were triggered upon detecting suspicious activity from the attacker.
- Logs provided valuable insights into attack patterns.

### **5.2 Known Issue: IP Blocking Not Working**
Despite successful detection and alerting, the automated blocking of Kali Linux's IP address did not execute as expected. Potential reasons include:
- **Script Execution Issues** ‚Äì The blocking script may not have the correct permissions or execution rights.
- **Splunk User Permissions** ‚Äì The Splunk service may lack administrative privileges to modify firewall rules.
- **Firewall/IPS Integration Gaps** ‚Äì If an external firewall was used, API calls may not be configured correctly.
- **Incorrect Action Triggering** ‚Äì Splunk may not be properly executing the blocking command.

## **7. Conclusion**
This SOC lab successfully demonstrated the ability to detect cyber threats in real time using Splunk. While the automatic blocking mechanism did not function as intended, the project provided valuable hands-on experience in security monitoring and incident detection.

## **8. Next Steps & Improvements**
- Debug and resolve the IP blocking issue.
- Expand the SOC lab with additional attack scenarios.
- Integrate a full-fledged Intrusion Prevention System (IPS) for automated response.
- Optimize alerting thresholds to reduce false positives.
