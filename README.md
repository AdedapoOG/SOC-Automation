# SOC-Automation
# 🛡️ Security Operations Center (SOC) Home Lab

## 📌 Project Overview
This project sets up a **Security Operations Center (SOC) Home Lab** to monitor, detect, and respond to cyber threats. The lab includes **Splunk SIEM**, **Snort IDS**, and **Metasploit** to simulate real-world attacks and analyze security events.

## 🎯 **Objectives**
✅ **Deploy Splunk SIEM** to collect and analyze security logs.  
✅ **Implement an IDS (Snort)** to detect network intrusions.  
✅ **Simulate cyber attacks** using Metasploit on a vulnerable machine.  
✅ **Automate detection and response** using custom Splunk rules.  
✅ **Generate a report** on attack scenarios and mitigation techniques.

##  **Lab Setup**
### **📌 System Requirements**
- **VMware Workstation** or **VirtualBox** for virtualization
- **At least 8GB RAM** (16GB+ recommended)
- **3 Virtual Machines (VMs)**:
  -  **Splunk SIEM VM** (Ubuntu-based)
  - **Kali Linux** (Attacker VM)
  -  **Metasploitable** (Victim VM)

##  **Installation Steps**
### **Step 1: Clone the Repository**
# 🛡️ Phase 1: Setting Up the SOC Lab Environment  

## 📌 Overview  
In this phase, I set up a **Security Operations Center (SOC) home lab** by deploying:  
- **Splunk SIEM (Ubuntu Server)** for log analysis.  
- **Kali Linux (Attacker VM)** for penetration testing.  
- **Metasploitable (Victim VM)** for simulating attacks.
- **VMware Workstation** To run and network these virtual machines.
